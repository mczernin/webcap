- needle sucks, use request,
[x] switch from amanda to js-schema
    : json schema is huge incomplete specification. json schema is bull
    : js-schema is elegant, easy, and documented
- union for http server pipeline? or connect? devonly? back to restify
- istanbul away, probably,
    - test-cov script away
- replace mocha? anything else than some kid's rtfs project,
    - for tape?
        - if tape, then this go away(no tap output): expect instead of chai? or is chai better documented?,
    : remember to check vows
    - remove mocha.opts
    : tried tap, tape, vows. mocha seems the best ;_;
- set test to be run with grunt
- document to developer how not to run "nodemon" and "tests"
- remove unnecessary dependencies
- test project from clone to npm install to tests, heroku too (test for heroku? ehh..)
- cors
    - tests to check content-type: application/json? force it to be sent as well if not already?
- enable ability to use as a library as well
- global bin/
- NODEMON ?
- if no need: remove grunt, use nodemon by itself until it's needed
    : less deps the better
- check that node_modules/bin/X is valid to put here and there..that it stays
    : at least (taken from npm-folders): "When in local mode, executables are linked into ./node_modules/.bin "
- better error messages everywhere? especially webcap

--  MOCHA

--  OTHER TESTING FRAMEWORKS
dont remember. went through tap, tape, vows

-- VOW
+no deps
+simple
+-good doc, but some things are left out BUT save comes from the fact that they are clearly inferred from the guiding text
- returning a deferred promise from .then exits the parent promise chain: doesn't take into account the fact that promise never resolved/rejected. TODO:ask/bugreport?
